traces_raw= neural activity traces uncorrected
traces = neural activity traces corrected for bleaching
tracesDif = derivative of traces
IDs = identified neuron IDs
timeVectorSeconds = time vector in seconds
fps = frames per second
dataset = name of dataset
stimulus
	-identity = what was changed e.g. O2 (oxygen)
	-type = stimulus type e.g. binary steps
	-switchtimes =  time in seconds when stimulus changed from initial state to the other state
	-initialstate = the state that the stimulus starts with, refers to "conc"
	-conc = the concentrations of the stimulus
	-concunits - units of the "conc"


States = vector of different state types (8 states for WT_NoStim, 4 states for WT_Stim and AVA_HisCl

8 states for WT_NoStim:
	‘FWD’ forward crawling 
	‘SLOW’ forward slowing
	‘DT’ dorsal post reversal turn
	‘VT’ ventral post reversal turn
	‘REV1’ reverse crawling
	‘REV2’ reverse crawling
	‘REVSUS’ sustained reverse crawling
	‘NOSTATE’ - ambiguous

4 states for WT_Stim and AVA_HisCl:
	‘FWD’ forward crawling 
	‘REV’ reverse crawling
	‘REVSUS’ sustained reverse crawling
	‘TURN’ post reversal turn
